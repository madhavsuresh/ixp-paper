Peering matrices of Internet exchange points (IXPs) have been an area of interest because of their
critical role in the flow of traffic. \cite{Augustin:2009}
Remote peering at IXPs has been a recent trend, as it allows smaller ASs to bypass more costly 
peering agreements.
Efforts have been made to discover peering matrices at IXPs however no work has been done 
to discover remote peers. We designed and implemented a tool that can determine remote peerings
given a peering list of an IXP. Using traceroutes obtained from Dasu \cite{Sanchez:2011}, geolocation
techniques and reverse dns, we were able to determine remote peerings with 
%TODO: 
(WHAT?) level of accuracy.

\section{Introduction}

\{include stuff about IXPs and whatnot here\}

Remote peering at IXPs is the practice of peering without a collocated router at an IXP. Smaller ASs
who want to bypass transit links can use remote peering as a method to lower cost and meet geographic 
diversity requirements. Currently mapping tools exists for determining peering matrices at 
IXPs however nothing exists to determine which peers are remote peers.

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a programmatic remote peer finder
that is capable of determining remote peers with a (WHAT?) level of confidence. 



\section{System Design}
We implemented a multifiltering mechanism to avoid false negatives and increase confidence in our results.
First we determine which peerings we suspect to be those of long-haul links, 
then we verify that finding with geolocation. For added confidence,
we augment the mappings with reverse DNS names. 

\subsection{System Architecture}
\subsubsection{Determining Long Haul Links}
In a traditional IXP setup, all peers are present at the physical location of the IXP. 
As such every peer has a physical interface at router in the IXP, and the latency hop between
to peers comes directly from the latency of the router. Remote peers however are not physically 
present at the IXP. We found that many remote peers were connected through an MPLS tunnel.
MPLS is a layer two mechanism which bypasses traditional layer three routing, and sends data directly
from source to destination. Since MPLS is a layer two protocol, traditional traceroutes fail to capture when 
they traverse MPLS links. Unfortunately our dataset from Dasu only included traditional traceroutes. Paris traceroutes
are able to determine MPLS links, and we were able to run tests on LookingGlass nodes that offered them. This had to be done
manually so it was not practical. In the future we hope to add paris traceroutes to Dasu to facilitate this. 
In addition not all remote peers use MPLS links, so another method was also necessary to avoid a large number of
false negatives.  
We made the assumption that a peer that experiences a larger than average
latency hop is most likely a remote peer. There were of course false positives, but 
through our filtering process we hoped to remove of those. With a set of traceroutes from
Dasu \cite{Sanchez:2011} we narrowed down the traces to routes that were known to go through IXPs.
We then set a threshold for latency around \{WHAT WAS THE LATENCY?\}ms which we determined through
looking at the average trace of peers connected at the IXP. At this point the system has ouputted 
what it thinks are long haul links. It then moves to corroborate this set against geolocation data.
\subsubsection{Geolocation}
Given the IPs that we suspect to be longhaul links we use geolocation on the IP to determine where
the interface is located. If the interface is not located in the same area, the we have found a 
remote peering, if it is we discard the IP. To do the geolocation we used the tulip tool from the Stanford
National Accerleator Lab. One of the problems we face with geolocation was the 
accuracy which we
